.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBGraphical Modeler\fR is
a \fIwxGUI\fR component which allows the user to
create, edit, and manage complex models using easy\-to\-use
interface. When performing analytical operations in GRASS, the
operations are not isolated, but part of a chain of operations. Using
Graphical Modeler, that chain of processes (ie. GRASS modules)
can be wrapped into one process (ie. model). So it\(cqs easier to execute
the model later with slightly different inputs or parameters.
.PP
The modeler can be launched from the Layer Manager menu File \->
Graphical modeler or from the main
toolbar . It\(cqs also
available as stand\-alone module \fIg.gui.gmodeler\fR.
